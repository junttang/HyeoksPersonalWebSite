# My-Personal-Website
This is my personal website for **introducing myself to public and also preparing some future interviews** by regarding this site as a **portfolio**.

The html site is programmed based on the bootstrap & JAVA script. I downloaded the template uploaded on the internet and customized it. You can see the detail source code by opening the file name 'index.html' with any kinds of IDE software. I mainly used the microsoft visual studio 2017 to customize.
